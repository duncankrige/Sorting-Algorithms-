Overview

This project implements various sorting algorithms in C++, including Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, System Sort, and Heap Sort. It sorts an array of integers and compares the performance of these different algorithms.

Algorithms Implemented

Bubble Sort: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.

Merge Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves and recursively sorts them before merging them back together.

Quick Sort: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that picks a pivot and partitions the array around it, sorting the subarrays recursively.

System Sort: Uses the built-in system sorting function for comparison purposes.

Heap Sort: Converts the array into a heap structure and then sorts it by repeatedly removing the root.
